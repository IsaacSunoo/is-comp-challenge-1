## Static Comp Challenge 1

### By Isaac Sunoo

#### Overview
The second week of the front end program at Turing required recreating a web design and also having it be responsive.  Having complimentary colors and designing all the html with css was good on hands practice to getting repetition in as well as learning new css properties and how they worked.
With time, the html and css code and actual page will keep improving, but constantly learning and practicing is great for making progress to become a better developer.
